# Please answer the following questions and submit them as part of the solution package when you are done with it. 

## 1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make it the right next step in your career? 
```
Challenges. I like it when the job/position does not let you stop learning. When it pushes you to be better.
```

## 2. What have you learned so far about LawnStarter that excited you?
```
The acting area and the growth potential both for the company as for myself
```

## 3. Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? We have QA (Quality Assurance) and a Product Operations team, however, they exist to provide support to engineers. Are you comfortable going to a place where the quality buck stops with the engineers and you have the ability to deploy and observe your own code in production? 
```
I do have already worked in such environment and I still do and I promote and defend this model of working.
```

## 4. What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?
```
For tech, I would say AI and machine learning. I already had the chance to "study" about it but everybody knows "hello world" is not learning.

In the matter of any other subject, I would pick management, I would go with everything I can possibly learn about it
